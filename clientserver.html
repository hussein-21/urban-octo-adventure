    <h1>Client Server computing</h1>

    <p>by Hussein Alsaidi</p>

    <h2>What is the client/server model?</h2>

    <p> The client/server computing model, or architecture, is a computer/software network model in which some computers
        or software act as "clients" that make "requests" for a data or a service and other computers or software act as
        "servers" that listen for and respond to these requests. For example, a web client (e.g. a computer running the
        Chrome browser) makes requests for web pages from a web server (another computer running a web server software
        such as Apache).</p>
    <h2>Several major advantages of the client/server model</h2>

    <p>Several major advantages of the client/server model are:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Centralized security and administration
        <li>scalability (easy to add more servers and increase capabilities/power)
        <li>Centralized client/user backup and recover
        <li>User collaboration and shared resources, e.g. file server, printers, faxes, databases, etc.
    </ol>

    <h2>Examples of client/server software</h2>

    <h2>Examples of TCP/IP (suite) protocals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>FTP : protocol used to send/transfer/receive files from one computer to another (client to server and vice versa)
        <li>HTTP : protocol used to send/retrieve web pages over the Web using a Web browser
        <li>HTTPS : protocol used to send/retrieve web pages securely/encrypted over the Web using a Web browser
        <li>DHCP : protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on the Internet
        <li>SMTP : used to send email messages
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of network utilities and services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ping : utility used to test whether a host on a network is reachable/available.
        <li>tracert : utility that displays the path packets are taking to get from your current location/device on a network to another location on a network. The number of hops and how long each hop takes is displayed allowing one to see if and where there are any delays between the two locations.
        <li>pathping : utility that combines the features of ping and tracert.
        <li><a href="https://whois.icann.org/en">whois</a> : utility that allows you to look-up who owns an Internet resource, such as a domain name or IP address block.
        <li>ipconfig :  utility that allows you to look-up and configure a devices IP address, DHCP, and DNS information.
    </ul>
